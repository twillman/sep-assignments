1. The difference in adding the same items to both the binary search tree and
the min heap is that the binary search tree is sorted such that any item to the
left of another item, regardless of height in the tree, is guaranteed to be less
than everything to the right of it; whereas, in a min heap, everything on one
level is guaranteed to be lower rated than everything in the levels below it,
regardless of the left to right positions.

2.  Insertions of an ordered range should be faster in the min heap, but search
should on average be faster in the binary search tree, apart from small numbers.
A deletion will depend on the size of the data structure, as to which is faster,
but both involve the steps of finding, replacing and multiple comparisons, but
after potential replacement, a heap will max out at 2 comparisons and potential
movements.  The prime benefit of a heap is in the case of quick max/min retrieval
as well as faster insertion , and the prime benefit of a binary search tree is
overall optimized search.
